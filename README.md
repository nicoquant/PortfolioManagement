This repository will store some projects regarding portfolio management and backtests.

# PortfolioOpt.py

One can find the implementation of the mean variance, tangency and efficient portfolio

# Backtest.py

One can find the backtesting framework assiciated to the PortfolioOpt.py script. You can compute the variance covariance matrix using historical resturns, and you can decide
to update the matrix during the backest: calibration_of_var_cov='dynamic'
